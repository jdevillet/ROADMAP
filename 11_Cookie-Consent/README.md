# Description

Create a simple cookie consent popup that appears when the user visits the page. The popup will include a message and a button to accept the consent. Once accepted, the popup will disappear.

Bonus points if you persist the userâ€™s consent using cookies or local storage and prevent the popup from appearing on subsequent visits.
