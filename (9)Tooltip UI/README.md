# Description

Create a tooltip that appears above navigation items when hovered, using only HTML and CSS. A tooltip is a small pop-up box that provides additional information about a navigation item when a user hovers over it. This project will focus on mastering CSS positioning, hover effects, and creating visually appealing tooltips without relying on JavaScript.
